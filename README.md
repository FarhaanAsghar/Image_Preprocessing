## Purpose

This tutorial aims to discuss several methods for preprocessing images before they are fed into the model-building process.

## Introduction

This repository features a Jupyter notebook that explores various techniques in digital image processing using OpenCV. The notebook includes examples and code snippets for noise removal, image sharpening, and contrast enhancement. It also demonstrates advanced techniques using deep learning models such as EDSR, Real-ESRGAN, and GFP-GAN for super-resolution and image enhancement.
